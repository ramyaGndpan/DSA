 * Inheritance and Static Methods
Create a superclass named Vehicle with a static method showInfo() that prints "This is a vehicle." 
Create a subclass Car that extends Vehicle and overrides the showInfo() method to print "This is a car." 
Demonstrate how the behavior of static methods changes when accessed through the subclass.

/**
Method Hiding :
If a subclass defines a static method with the same signature as a static method in the superclass, then the method in the subclass hides the one in the superclass. This mechanism happens because the static method is resolved at the compile time. Static method bind during the compile time using the type of reference not a type of object.

Note: 
=> method hiding=> method binding happened at compile time for the static methods based on the type of reference => hence method resolved at compile time itself 
=> method overriding=> method binding happened based on the type of objects created (dynamic binding) for the non static methods => hence method resolved at run time 

Difference Between Method Overriding and Method Hiding in Java
    In method overriding both the method parent class and child class are non-static.
    In method Hiding both the method parent class and child class are static.
    In method Overriding method resolution is done on the basis of the Object type.
    In method Hiding method resolution is done on the basis of reference type.
    The version of the overridden instance method that gets invoked is the one in the subclass.
    The version of the hidden static method that gets invoked depends on whether it is invoked from the superclass or the subclass.

Important Points about method overriding and static methods

The following are some important points for method overriding and static methods in Java. 

For class (or static) methods, the method according to the type of reference is called, not according to the object being referred, which means method call is decided at compile time.
For instance (or non-static) methods, the method is called according to the type of object being referred, not according to the type of reference, which means method calls is decided at run time.
An instance method cannot override a static method, and a static method cannot hide an instance method. For example, the following program has two compiler errors. 
In a subclass (or Derived Class), we can overload the methods inherited from the superclass. Such overloaded methods neither hide nor override the superclass methods â€” they are new methods, unique to the subclass.
